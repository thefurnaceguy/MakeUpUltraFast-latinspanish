Some of the code is inspired by the ideas presented below:

------

- Enhanced ambient occlusion is based on Capt Tatsu's ambient occlusion used in
  BSL Shaders:
  https://bitslablab.com/bslshaders/

- Shadow bias technique from Emin implementation, based on a concept
  reimagined by gri573:

I am not a graphics developer, I made this shader out of curiosity and
my personal use, but I think it is good enough to be shared.

I have not copied, but have tried to learn, adapt and modify
other people's ideas in favor of the shader.
